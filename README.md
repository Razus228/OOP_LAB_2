# OOP_LAB_2

In this laboratory work I had to deal with soemthing new for me at it is Encapsulation

I used this term to create a bank simulator.

For it to work I used :

1.Head Office 
(It controls the bank itself, and controls everyone that works, enters there)
2.Employers 
(They are the ones that control the employees, and they require an ID, a name, and age)
3.Employees 
(The ones who serve customers, I gave them and ID, a name, IDNP, Age, and Gender)
4.Clients 
(They keep the bank working through their operations and money, they have Name,IDNP, Age, Addres, Gender)
5.Cards 
(A way of monitorizing your salary and money through a bank they have an ID, a Pin code, a amount of money)
6.Exchange
(Where you can go and exchange for example euro for leis, it has Dollarand euro exchange rate)
7.Deposit (
It works by storing the money in the bank, it has ID and Amount of money stored)
8.Loan 
(Taking in credit money from the bank is not the best idea but it keeps the bank working, ID, Amout and Monthly Rate)
9.Atm's 
(the thing where you put your card and use it, it takes Card ID, a Adress and the Amount of money to take or give)
10.Transaction 
(I mean that you give money to other's people cards or to other countries, it needs an ID, and a Amount)

All in all it was a great experience learning something new and using different websites to learn more about encapsulation and it's concepts.
